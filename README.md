# NesCartDB.com Backup

## About NesCartDB.com Backup

This is a FULL BACKUP of the NESCartDB project made by Bootgod and contributed data to it by DOZENS of AMAZING, FANTASTIC people, many of which seem to be part of the "NesDev" community. I made this backup in April 2025 as a pre-emptive measure to ensure all of this data will always be saved and available forever. This backup contains ALL the data and ALL images. I have FAITHFULLY re-implemented (using the Laravel PHP framework) as closely to Bootgod's original PHP web application as I could, so all features like Advanced Search are working perfectly fine!

Size of this backup:

* Database - SQLite - 22.9MB
* Images - 22013 Unique Images - 2.44GB

4,599 Unique Cart Profiles!

  This is a backup of NES Cart Database (NesCartDB.com) which is a project first made by bootgod, and contributed to with help from lots of the kind friendly people in the "NesDev" NES homebrew development community. This backup is COMPLETE with all images and data backed up as well. The images are 2.44GB, so not too large that it's difficult to manage.

The data is all stored in a SQLite database, which is contained in a single `database.sqlite` file that is included in this repository, which is 22.9MB. This database contains exactly 4,599 NES cart profiles that have been documented as part of this project.

Complete with all the images and data, backed up into this functionally equivalent PHP web app.


## Installation

To install a copy of this NESCartDB backup and get it running on your local machine, simply follow all of these instructions and hopefully it should work in no time! I'm not a seasoned experienced veteran at making README.md installation instructions, so if you have any feedback or suggestions how I can make these installation instructions clearer or easier/quicker to understand, I am open to hearing them!

### Step 1 - Clone a copy of this github repository on your local computer

```shell
git clone git@github.com:skcin7/nescartdb_backup.git
cd nescartdb_backup
composer install
```

Step 2 - This implementation also contains its own configuration file, which you can optionally change to adjust some basic settings. This configuration file is located in `/config/nescartdb.php`. Currently, the only configuration option is `num_latest_dumps_to_show`. Change this number to change how many "Latest Dumps" show up in the layout of each page. The default value is 10.
